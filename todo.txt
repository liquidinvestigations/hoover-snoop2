- [x] snoop/data/collections.py -- implement create_roots() using minio
- [x] snoop/management/command/purge.py -- add/remove minio buckets
- [x] CI -- add to drone
- [x] testsuite/test_lifecycle.py -- delete all minio buckets; maybe also do in other tests?
- [x] snoop/data/blob.py -- rewrite using minio
- [ ] snoop/data/blob.py -- fetch original blobs from source minio, instead of duplicating blob
- [ ] delete old, unneeded blobs (when originals also exist)

- [ ] split worker command lines into 3:
  - disk workers (require orig data, tmp drive)
  - http workers (scaled differently, remove need for tmp drive, use normal temp)
  - normal workers (no temp, no disk)

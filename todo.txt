- [x] split archives: 7zip
- [x] split archives: zip
      'volname.zip', 'volname.z01', 'volname.z02'
    - we can *probably* mount the same split archives with concat-fuse
- [x] split archives: rar
      these can be:
        Filename.part1.rar   <-- first
        Filename.part2.rar
        Filename.part3.rar

      or:
        Filename.part01.rar   <-- first
        Filename.part02.rar
        Filename.part03.rar

      or:
        Filename.part001.rar   <-- first
        Filename.part002.rar
        Filename.part003.rar

      or:
        Filename.000.rar   <-- first
        Filename.001.rar
        Filename.002.rar

      or:
        Filename.rar   <-- first
        Filename.r00
        Filename.r01

      Also, we might not be able to mount these (since each file has a separate header and structure), so the p7zip hack might not work. In that case, simply unarchive the splits as usual.


- [ ] split worker command lines into 3:
  - disk workers (require orig data, tmp drive)
  - http workers (scaled differently, remove need for tmp drive, use normal temp)
  - normal workers (no temp, no disk)

- [ ] extract split archives from places that aren't *mounted* archives or original data filesystems
    - if the source archives for the split are only found in Blob storage (e.g. from email),
      then we give `7z` the path to some `/ab/cd/912348...` file that doesn't
      have an extension, and that isn't next to its split files.
    - identify when we encounter a split archive, and identify  its other split parts
    - symlink all the parts in a folder and run 7z on the first item (see filename format list above)
- [ ] mount split archives instead of unpacking
    - we can mount split archives if they're combined with concat-fuse (or rather its script cfconcat)
    - this should work for 7z and zip
    - we need to figure out the file list ourselves, and give them all to cfconcat
    - if this does not work, fallback to usual unpacking
